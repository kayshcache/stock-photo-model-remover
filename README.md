# Chrome Extension: Stock Photo Model Remover
## Remove photos of fake people from your experience of the web
### Disgusted by fake people pretending to enjoy products? This extension is for you.
This Chrome extension does facial recognition on the faces of people in photos on any site you visit. If it finds a person's face in any stock photography repo or commercial marketing photo distribution service, it will cover the photos with a grey square and text indicating FAKE PEOPLE REMOVED - simply click on the photo to uncover.
Advertisers have power to display whatever picture they like on the streets - let's take back the Internet from these manipulative and cynical agencies.
Why models? Models are not people like you and I, they are designed representations of what people can look like, but only if they spend all day in the gym or at a hair salon. We live our lives for real and we want to be represented by candid images of real customers or community members.
If you like these ideas please use our extension with Chrome or Brave Browser. And contribute to this 'Unlicence' open-source project.
Thank you for reading.
